# Tremble
*A simple tremolo plugin*

## Todo

* Consider if square and saw waves should be included.
* Handle stereo and multiple channels correctly.
* Implement sync-mode.
* Implement phase flipping.
* Consider if wave-summation works the way it should.

## Notes

* For some reason the Biquad implementation introduces distortions. The built-in JUCE FIR filter does as well.
